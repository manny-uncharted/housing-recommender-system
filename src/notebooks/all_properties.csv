It is home to a plethora of cultures and peoples from all over the U. K. and from around the world, which makes it a much more interesting environment to live in than was previously the case (say 5 â 10 years ago).   And, there is a multitude of newly opened shops, bars, restaurants, gyms, markets and places of entertainment, etc, close by (some of them open 24 hours) all the way from the property to the newly developed Elephant & Castle area in one direction,  and to the fast developing Camberwell area in the other, providing you with an abundant supply of places to go and things to see and do in the local area â day or night!   Markets: East Street market is the closest. You can find some amazing bargains here. Other markets not so far away include Borough market, Lower Marsh Food Market, Bermondsey Square Farmers and Antiques Markets, Oval Farmersâ Market, and the New Covent Garden Flower Market(s) are all close byâ¦between 5 and 15 minutes on the bus, approximately.    Parks: Burgess Park (one of the largest in Southeast London) is just around the corner (1 â 2 minutesâ walk), and Kennington Park is about 5 â 10 minutesâ walk awayâ¦so quite close too. Burgess Park has a big lake for boating and fishing, an internationally recognised BMX bike racing track, a Tennis Centre, a Preserved Woodland area, an Adventure area (for both children and adults), Football areas, Public Barbecue zones, large entertainment spaces for concerts, circuses and fairs, and an Outdoor Gym, etc, etc!   Shopping, Entertainment & The Arts: within 10 â 20 minutes by bus and / or tube, you will find yourself in the heart of many of Londonâs historic and cultural landmarks. Regent Street, Oxford Street, Knightsbridge, Kensington (for The Natural History and V & A Museums, etc), Hyde Park (for the many festivals and shows, etc, throughout the yearâ¦including The Winter Wonderland around Christmas time), The Tower of London, The South Bank Centre, including The Hayward Gallery, The National Theatre and Royal Festival Hall are also close by, as are the IMAX cinema at Waterloo, the National Film Museum, Shakespeareâs Globe, The Imperial War Museum, The Tate Modern, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, The Royal Opera House and The Coliseum, Covent Garden and Theatre & Film Land around Leicester Square, on the Strand as well as on Shaftsbury Avenue, etc, in the West Endâ¦ and letâs not forget the City of Londonâ¦the financial heart (and brain) of the U. K.! I could go onâ¦   Sport: A Gym, just 3 â 5 minutesâ walk away on the Walworth Road, and now also at the NEW Elephant & Castle Leisure Centre (12 â 15 minutesâ walk away), are open 24 hours. Thereâs very cheap (sometimes freeâ¦) swimming as well at Camberwell Leisure Centre (just 12 - 15 minutesâ walk in the other direction - towards Camberwell Green). Thereâs also a Rock-Climbing wall at Vauxhall (under the railway arches) as well as, of course, the world famous Oval Cricket Ground close by (between Vauxhall, Kennington and Camberwell).   More about The Elephant & Castle (just 12 â 15 minutesâ walk away): FYI, over the next few years, the Elephant & Castle will become London's most exciting new neighbourhood in a Â£1.5bn transformation that will evolve and enhance its identity. It will very soon become known as âthe place to beâ rather than just âa place to pass throughâ.   Already a lively London neighbourhood, The Elephant & Castle offers all the convenience of a Zone 1 location. Known affectionately to the locals as 'The Elephant', the area has a rich history stretching back to medieval timesâ¦and so much more to offer residents, visitors, and investors, etc, alike.   Located in a prime position in the heart of (south) central London, The Elephant & Castle is an excellent transport hub, with a Mainline Train station (direct trains to Kings Cross, Luton, Gatwick Airport and Brighton), a Zone 1 Tube station, of course, and links to nearly 50 different Bus routes. Fast and frequent London Underground services connect you to the whole of London via the Northern and Bakerloo lines.   Once all the main infrastructure projects have been completed, The Elephant & Castle will become one of the first fully Internet and social media friendly residential neighbourhoods in the whole of London.   GETTING AROUND:   The property is also, approximately, 15 - 20 minutesâ walk (5 - 10 minutes by bus & 7 - 10 minutes by bike) away from the Elephant & Castle Underground and Overground Stations, with their fast connections to anywhere you can think of in London and beyond.    The property is also served by a myriad of day and night buses stopping nearby (approx. 2 minutesâ walk in either direction). They can also get you quickly to where you need to be.   There are various âpedalâ bike stations 5 â 7 mins walk away (approx), with several others all along the Walworth Road up to the Elephant & Castle station. There are many cycle routes to choose from, including the CS7.   Parking: If required, Parking Permits can be applied for through the Southwark Council website.   On Foot: FYI, Borough Market is around 25 mins away, London Bridge about 30 mins, The South Bank is approximately 40 mins away, Covent Garden and Leicester Squareâ¦ 50 mins, Euston, St. Pancras, and Kingâs Cross stationsâ¦just over an hour (each).

"2 Bed Penthouse, Leonard Street, EC2A","£3,700",11th floor," Key Points Becoming available November 2023. Fantastic location Minutes walk from the centre of the City of London, from Liverpool St Station, from Old St underground Located in Central Shoreditch - currently home to 7 of the UKâs top 100 restaurants - and endless more restaurants, bars, cafes and clubs, Brick Lane and Spitalfields Countless art, music and cultural events in the neighbourhood Overlooking wonderful old yellow London brick warehouses Property Description A huge 90m2 2-bed, 2 bathroom, with a massive reception room, flooded with daylight from windows running the length of the property. The full-length balcony overlooks the vibrant Leonard Street (inside Congestion Zone). This Penthouse is one of only 6 residential units in the building which stands on a former wartime bomb-site. It is absolutely centrally located to modern London and the area that has been at the heart of the East End revival: much of modern British Art (like it or not) and part of Hoxton ( so hip it hurts!). Located in the Creative area, minutes walk from the financial district,  it is an unbeatable location but the (relatively) small size of the block keeps it in contact with the vibrant surrounding streets. It is rented directly by the Landlord who lived in the building for 15 years (so no agent fees, no agent bull) Located on 4th Floor, with no lifts, the stairs ensure you are kept fit.

"Room in a Shared Flat, Mayfield Close, E8","£1,250",9th floor,"                                Looking for one person to complete a two bed spacious flat with me and my gorgeous little beagle in Dalston. Iâm a mid 30s female from Devon and Oli is an 11 year old beagle from Ecuador. I work at home a few days a week so would be looking for someone who works the majority of the week out of the flat. Iâd love someone chilled and independent who has their own life but also wants to share the occasional dinner, watch a movie or grab a drink in one of the many bars in Dalston. Iâm fairly quiet during the week, but still like to go out sometimes at the weekend and spend my time reading, would be great to live with someone similar. Iâm not looking to live with a couple and if you have a partner I think it works best if they were only with us less than half the week. Obviously itâs really important that you love dogs, Oli loves everyone so heâll want to spend time with you. The photos are of the flat previously, the furniture is different as Iâm currently in the process of furnishing it myself, if you have your own furniture that you wanted to bring then let me know. The flat is quite spacious with lovely tiled floors and a cute balcony. Thereâs a communal garden that people use a lot and Iâm pretty sure we can get you parking if you need it. Ideally Iâd like someone to move in asap so please let me know when youâd be able to move in. If youâre interested then please message me if youâd like to come by and tell me a bit about you and why you think we might be a good fit. Looking forward to hearing from you!

A large sitting room with bay windows, colourful furnishings and art work complements a retro eat-in kitchen at the other end of the flat, joined by a hallway-library. Iâve lived here for 12 years and love this neighbourhood with its diverse culture and restaurants, not to mention Londonâs best park (boasting tennis courts, lido, BMX track, duck ponds, London skyline, manor house, meadows and vast varieties of trees). Iâm looking for part-time renters (a couple, friends or a single person) while I spend the Autumn in France. More than anything Iâm seeking the right people to live in and cherish the space. As Iâm moving out of the country for a few months the flat will be let as seen ie with art work, furnishings, books, plants, kitchenware etc. Thatâs why it matters to me that the right people want to live here.Bills are cÂ£156/m (water, council tax, Wi-Fi) but are not inclusive of electricity and gas so Iâd transfer the energy bill (gas & electric) to whoever rents it so youâd be in control of and responsible for what you use. A weekly cleaner is included in the rent. Iâm open to a dialogue on whether to extend the tenancy depending on how my time abroad works out. I understand not everyone will be up for such an arrangement but happy to meet those of you who are. Please save us all some time by only requesting a viewing if the criteria fit - Mid Sep- early/mid Dec let, 2 people max, fully furnished etc. Viewings available now - evenings and weekdays. I look forward to hearing from you!

"Room in a Shared Flat, Gascony Avenue, NW6","£1,250",3rd floor,"                                Lovely double bedroom available for rent in this spacious and stylish 3 bedroom apartment with patio/garden. You would be sharing with 2 professional females, we are 27 and 49 years old and get on extremely well. We also have 2 affectionate dogs at home, Bandit (Shiba Inu) and Sunny (Labrador cross). We are friendly and sociable and whilst we often spend time together watching TV, making dinner, socialising over a glass of wine or two, fussing over the dogs, having an occasional dinner party, we also quite like doing our own thing, the mood is very spontaneous and relaxed and we would love someone who is easy going and fits in with our home life. Important part to mention is that a suitable housemate would need to be very much at ease around dogs and not allergic to dog hair ;) , we have a weekly cleaner but with 2 dogs around there will inevitably be some dog hair lurking. We like to keep our home tidy and clean (not OCD but to a healthy level) so we would expect the same. Other than that we are simply hoping for general common sense, mindfulness and respect in a household to make everyoneâs home life enjoyable. The bedroom comes with double bed frame with 2 storage draws and a headboard (also a very good quality mattress). There is some space to fit a desk if you need to. Also there is a triple door wardrobe with hanging space and shelving (one of the doors has a full length mirror). There is a large open plan modern kitchen and a living room, French doors opening onto a wrap-around patio/garden, 1 full bathroom and an additional separate WC.

"2 Bed Flat, Trinder Road, N19","£2,650",10th floor,"                                This charming flat occupies the upper half of a terraced house on a quiet residential street located equidistant between Crouch End and Stroud Green. The local area is a genuinely wonderful part of London: within 15 minutes you can be in Finsbury Park, Alexandra Palace, Priory Park, Queen's Wood, Highgate Wood, or the Parkland Walk for space and exercise; in the bars and restaurants of Crouch End and the Stroud Green Road for a night out; at the Art House or Picturehouse to watch a film; or at the Park Road lido for an open air swim. The area is still full of independent, interesting businesses, and there are a number of excellent food produce shops -- whether delicatessens, fruit and veg sellers, or butchers.The W7 bus leaves from the end of the road, and arrives at Finsbury Park station within eight minutes; from there, the Victoria and Piccadilly Lines head into the middle of town, and there are trains heading direct into the City (Moorgate 14 minutes), and even direct to Gatwick Airport. The flat is also situated very near to Crouch Hill overground station, which is useful for getting up to Walthamstow, and to destinations in the west of London like Richmond and Kew.          The flat is bright and spacious, and presents a calm, understated and modern feel. It has been renovated and maintained to a very high standard over the past five years. There are wooden floors throughout, with a solid oak parquet that was recently laid in the lower half of the flat changing into elegantly painted floorboards in the upstairs bedroom. All the windows in the flat are sashes, which have been renovated and double-glazed within the last four years. The heart of the flat is a combined open-plan kitchen, dining area and living room. The kitchen has an induction hob, single oven, fridge / freezer and Bosch clothes washer / dryer. The three-sided kitchen surface is very generous for food preparation, and could also double as a breakfast bar. Next to the kitchen, the wide open room could simply be used as a very spacious living room; or -- as is the case currently -- divided into a dining area with ample space for a large dining table, next to a living area still with sufficient space for a sofa, armchairs and a sideboard.   The central stairway gives a real sense of flow to the flat, so that none of the rooms in the flat feel disconnected or remote. Despite that, the three distinct levels of the flat each retain a sense of privacy and self-sufficiency -- not least because each bedroom has its own separate bathroom.Heading up the staircase from the central living room, the main bedroom occupies the whole depth of house from front to back. The main feature of the bedroom is a distinctive painted brick chimney breast, next to which a beautiful ply-edged wardrobe has been custom-built, complete with oak veneer shelving for books and plants. In the same style as the wardrobe, a custom eaves storage unit runs the full width of the room and also provides some bed-side storage. Next to the back window that looks out over trees and gardens, there is plenty of room for a small office. The bedroom has its own bathroom, with full size bath, and more useful hidden eaves storage for larger items such as suitcases.Heading downstairs from the central living room, there is a second bedroom at the back of the flat, also with its own bathroom with a walk-in waterfall shower. The second bedroom is sufficiently spacious for an adult double bed and clothes storage or, as is currently the case, for two children's beds and equipment. Alternatively, this room could serve as a spacious and quiet office.In the front garden of the flat, there is a large Asgard metal bike storage shed that is exclusively for the use of the flat tenants.

Rent 1 bedroom apartment in London,3479 €,2nd floor,"a fantastic 1st floor loft style apartment measuring approx 1151sqft in one of clerkenwell's most iconic developments - the ziggurat building. this unique apartment has a special kind of charm, a charm which possibly comes from living in a converted art deco printworks. the apartments exposed brick, high ceilings, and oversized windows enables you to unleash your creativity and model the interiors the way you like. the ziggurat is a landmark development further benefits from a secure ground floor entrance with daytime concierge, telephone intercom system and two passenger lifts. the apartment is situated on saffron hill, ideally placed for access to all of the bars and restaurants that farringdon has to offer as well as the city and the west end. the nearest tube is farringdon (hammersmith & city, metropolitan, circle lines & the soon to be completed crossrail terminal) with holborn station also walking distance (central & piccadilly lines). history of clerkenwell in medieval times, the bishop of ely was a powerful man. he built his palace just outside the city of london, at nearby ely place (place = palace). he planted out his garden with saffron crocuses from his estate at saffron walden, on the site of what is now saffron hill. the bishop and ely place feature in several shakespeare plays. john of gaunt's famous ""sceptred isle"" speech (""richard ii"") was delivered at ely place - where he was staying because his own palace, the savoy, had been burned down in the peasants' revolt. the peasants had camped out on nearby clerkenwell green. but that is another story. in the 1500s the bishop regularly hosted banquets for king henry viii and queen elizabeth i. but he made the mistake of falling out with his neighbour, sir christopher hatton - who gives his name to nearby hatton garden. hatton was a favourite of elizabeth, and she gave ely place to him. the bishop's palace fell into ruins. only the chapel survives - as st etheldreda's in ely place; the oldest catholic church in the country, a posh place for weddings and worth a visit. the rest of the palace was pulled down and ely place rebuilt in the 18th century. the ancient mitre pub also survives in the alley running between ely place and hatton garden. ely place is still a private road, run by commissioners elected annually by the freeholders and leaseholders. they appoint beadles (whose lodge is by the gates at the end of ely place). the hattons did not prosper. in particular, bleeding heart yard (between ely place and saffron hill) takes its name from the discovery there of the dismembered corpse of lady hatton - believed to have been murdered by a jealous lover. from there on, it was all downhill for several centuries. saffron hill became renowned for its brothels and thieves' rookeries. the fleet river ran where farringdon road is now, and formed a convenient escape route when the law came calling. the area features as the location of a number of low-life characters in the novels of charles dickens (who lived not far away in doughty street). in particular, fagin's den in ""oliver twist"" was situated in saffron hill, and bleeding heart yard features in ""little dorrit"". in the late 19th century clerkenwell became a place for craft, watchmaking and jewellery workshops. it was then a very radical area. karl marx lived next to clerkenwell green when writing ""das kapital"". and hiram maxim invented the machine gun in the building on the corner of hatton garden and clerkenwell road. the area became popular with italian immigrants, and became known as ""little italy"". there is still a sizeable italian community locally, and the italian church on clerkenwell road draws its congregation from far and wide. the craft workshops are still here. but advertising agencies and recording studios (including one in saffron hill) have moved in. and in the last 5 years clerkenwell has become ""fashionable clerkenwell"", with many former commercial premises (the ziggurat was a printing works) converted to residential use. hatton garden is still london's centre for the diamond trade - with lots of jewellery shops and workshops. many are jewish - closed saturday, open sunday. the huge building at the south end of saffron hill is the london headquarters of de beers, and the diamonds are delivered by helicopter to a landing pad on the roof. residential realtors offers the opportunity to make a 'pre viewing reservation' (pvr). pvrs are made on a non-obligation basis and are particularly popular with applicants who reside abroad and those unable to view properties as quick as required. pvr can be made at any point before your scheduled viewing, this gives you peace of mind that the property is reserved for you until your scheduled viewing slot. if you are not interested in the property after your viewng your pvr will be refunded to you within 24 hours. to make a 'pre viewing reservation' simply call residential realtors office on and member of the lettings team will be happy to walk you through the process. payments can be made over the telephone with a valid credit/debit card or via bank transfer. residential realtors offers late evening viewings and early morning veiwings along with most weekends, to arrange a vieiwngs simply call our lettings team on .00 + vat per person",,"apartment for rent at Saffron Hill, London, EC1N",51.5191478,-0.1059205,1.0,1.0

 The area: Why we love Lancaster Gate & Bayswater



 Why we love... Lancaster Gate & Bayswater
 Bayswater is one of London’s most cosmopolitan areas; renowned for its signature white Stucco fronted terraced houses and peaceful garden squares, many of which have been converted into flats. The architecture, combined with the central location, attracts successful young professionals and wealthy families. There is a significant international population with residents from the Arab countries, Greece, America and Brazil. What makes this area so unique is that despite its extremely central position Bayswater borders Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens that gives the area a sense of calm amongst the usual London hustle & bustle.
The location is quite simply superb; literally everything you need is within walking distance. The area boasts fantastic transport links, featuring key tube lines, major bus access, and walking distance to Paddington station for the Heathrow Express (15 minutes to the airport).
The area is a great destination for dining; there is a fantastic collection of ethnic cafes and restaurants serving international cuisine. It is also a shopper’s paradise, home to London’s oldest shopping center Whiteleys and a short distance from the world famous Selfridges department store.

The house is Grade II listed and has undergone an extensive and transformative refurbishment to create a lavish gated development comprising  of six stately apartments and six contemporary houses within the grounds.Apartment 3 is a wonderful lower ground apartment with its own entrance. The spacious high specification kitchen entertaining area has French doors opening up on to a terrace. There are also two well proportioned bedrooms, one with a contemporary en suite and both benefiting a luxurious family bathroom. The apartment benefits from extensive communal gardens, parking and leisure facilities. History Beltwood House is a beautiful neoclassical Victorian mansion situated in a private parkland setting extending to just over three acres.  This important architectural jewel is Grade II listed and has been sensitively restored to its former glory by a heritage-focused team of skilled craftspeople and artisans.  The house sits within protected woodland, part of the Dulwich Wood Conservation Area, with many of the trees protected by preservation orders.  Architecturally, Beltwood House has a rich heritage and is believed to have been designed by Robert Richardson Banks and Charles Barry Jr, who between them designed the main building of Dulwich College, Bylaugh Hall in Norfolk, the forecourt of Burlington House and 12 Kensington Palace Gardens, currently the Russian Embassy. Moreover, Barry's father designed the Houses of Parliament (Palace of Westminster), perhaps the most influential Gothic Revival building in the world.  A formal Italianate parterre garden was added to the grounds of Beltwood House at a later date.  One of the main goals in renovating Beltwood House and its grounds was to preserve this historic home and facilitate its removal from the English Heritage 'At Risk' register, restoring it to its original glory. Forming part of the Dulwich Estate (a charity established in 1619 to endow Dulwich College, and the guardian of the heritage of much of the Dulwich area) and, originally, the Great North Wood (an ancient wood which extended from Deptford in the north to Croydon in the south, remnants of which survive on the site itself and in Sydenham Hill Wood and Dulwich Wood), it is a unique property in a distinctive, sylvan setting.Available to rent through Knight Frank Dulwich.

It’s within walking distance to both the West End and the City! Four bedroom flats in such a central location are really difficult to find, especially at this price. Other good things about the flat are its proximity to three supermarkets (Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury’s all a stone’s throw away), its fibre optic internet connectivity (up to 120Mbps with Virgin Media) and cheap bills (gas central heating + unmetered water supply). Also, the landlord was a real pleasure to work with. Right from the start it was easy to tell that Jason is a reasonable, straightforward and responsive landlord. For example, he did not demand any hidden or extra fees (agency administration fees, property inspection etc) payable upon the start of the tenancy! We really appreciated how he was both a trustworthy and trusting person in all his dealings - that was certainly unlike most other landlords that we have encountered!""Another Testimonial from tenants:""We chose this apartment because of its great location and the spacious rooms. There are supermarkets nearby, two tube stations within walking distance and it is near to our school campus. For the given location, we felt that the rent rate was a very good deal. Overall, we had a great experience. Jason & Mina (the landlords) are very friendly and flexible even though we were international students.

Part of the Lower Lea Valley, Stratford is situated 6 miles (9.7 km) east-northeast of Charing Cross, and includes the localities of Maryland and East Village.Historically, part of the parish of West Ham, which formed an ancient parish in the hundred of Becontree in Essex. Following reform of local government in London in 1965, the parish and borough of West Ham was abolished, becoming part of the borough of Newham in the newly formed Greater London.Stratford grew rapidly in the 19th century following the introduction of the railway to the area in 1839, forming part of the conurbation of London, similar to much of south-west Essex. The late 20th century was a period of severe economic decline in the area, eventually reversed by ongoing regeneration associated with the 2012 Summer Olympics, for which Stratford's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, part of the large, multi-purpose Stratford City development, was the principal venue.

TTL was a private company with an unusual form of governance. It's nine executive directors were local residents; as is normal, they periodically submitted themselves to re-election. Thamesmead South SE2 split from the SE28 thamesmead, 'this is the original development In 2000, TTL was wound down and two new organisations were created. In broad terms, Gallions Housing Association took over the ownership and management of the housing assets whilst Tilfen, later Tilfen Land, took over the remaining undeveloped land. Tilfen is jointly owned by Gallions and Trust Thamesmead.District heating and cable radio broadcasting were pioneered in Thamesmead. The District Heating System was decommissioned around the turn of the millennium, with those properties connected to it having wet radiator systems installed by the landlord.Pilkington Canal (also called Broadwater Canal) - used to connect to Woolwich Arsenal, now remain as a water feature in the estates In time more facilities developed with a supermarket and retail park near Gallions Reach. Bus services were improved and people living on Thamesmead are now more easily able to reach Abbey Wood Station, which is a main stop on the line.View of canary wharf from Thamesmead North during the peak hours Transport Thamesmead's location between the Thames and the South London escarpment limits rail transport and road access points.  Most residents rely on bus services to reach the nearest rail stations.[citation needed] There is a disused railway trackbed from Plumstead which once served the Royal Arsenal. Buses serving Thamesmead include services B11, 177, 180, 229, 244, 380, 401, 469, 472, 601, 602, 669 and the night bus N1.Nearest railway stationsAbbey Wood railway stationPlumstead railway stationBelvedere railway stationWoolwich Arsenal railway stationGeography Thamesmead  today has four distict areas:Thamesmead South is in Bexley and is the location of the original development built in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The buildings are almost entirely of concrete, in a Cubist/Brutalist/Modernist style, and include a number of high-rise blocks. It is east of Harrow Mannor Way (A2041) and south of the A2016.Thamesmead Central is in Greenwich and was first developed in the early 1980s in the ring between the A206 and A2041. It originally consisted of large, sprawling, concrete and red brick, eight- and nine-storey estates overlooking the A2041, and three-storey red-brick town houses. It has spread west of the A2041 and now also includes a number of red and yellow brick homes built from the 1990s onwards.Thamesmead North is split between Bexley & Greenwich and is north of the A2016 and east of the A2041. Built from the 1970s onwards, it was initially made up of town houses in grey brick; more recent builds are in red & yellow brick.Thamesmead West is in Greenwich near Woolwich and Plumstead (Between Whinchat Road, the A2016 & the banks of the river Thames) and was built from the 1990s onwards. It is a significant distance from the original development and consists mainly of medium density residential development with yellow brick fascias, with towers along the riverside.Thamesmead now features a retail park finished in brick anchored around a Morrisons Supermarket; there is also a shopping parade which has mainly serviced based outlets such as hairdressers and estate agents. It contains a clock tower and lake, which may seem contrived. Thamesmead West contains Gallions Ecopark a pioneering small  housing development with homes built to high energy efficiency and environmental standards. The estate also includes a small lake and Gallions Hill (viewpoint hill).Part of Thamesmead West is also sometimes referred to as ""Gallions Reach Urban Village"". This can lead to confusion, as it is on the opposite bank of the River Thames from Gallions Reach DLR station and Gallions Reach shopping park. There is no Docklands Light Railway, London Underground or rail station in Thamesmead West.Most of the land area of Thamesmead previously formed about 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of the old Royal Arsenal site that extended over Plumstead Marshes and Erith Marshes. There is some evidence of prehistoric human occupation of the area - flints, animal bone and charcoal were found in bore holes around Western and Central Way in 1997 by the Museum of London Archaeological Service (MOLAS). In Roman times, the river level was significantly lower, and work by MOLAS in 1997 around Summerton Way found evidence of field ditches and pottery and quernstones from Germany dating from around the 3rd or 4th century. After the Roman era, river levels rose again and the area reverted to marshland.[4] According to Hasted, some areas of this marshland were drained by 1279 by the monks of Lesnes Abbey.Between 1812 and 1816, a canal was built (by convicts) to take materials (such as Timber) from the River Thames to Woolwich Royal Arsenal. Much of this canal has been filled in, but part remains in Thamesmead West and is now called the Broadwater. A lock gate and swing bridge (disused) still exists beside the River Thames over the canal.
