A mix of Edwardian and Neoclassical buildings characterise the neighbourhoodâs leafy streets, adding to its exclusive feel, but make no mistake:Fitzrovia has a friendly vibe. Surrounding the landscaped gardens, the apartments are carefully designed with top quality materials and refined clay brickwork to perfectly complement Fitzroviaâs strong architectural heritage. This prestigious development breathes new life into the already vibrant area, presenting an opportunity for anyone looking for a modern home in central Londonâs loveliest pocket.RestaurauntsLondonâs restaurant scene is second-to-none, and at the heart of it is Fitzrovia. Appealing to international tastes and styles, the areaâs cosy gastropubs, innovative restaurants and romantically-lit cocktail bars attract Londonâs fashionable crowd. On the other side of the building,development, residents can find the new and hugely popular italian restauraunt, Circolo Popolare. Indeed, in Fitzrovia and nearby Soho, thereâs everything from Venetian tapas at Polpo, to the fluffy steamed Taiwanese buns at Bao. Salt Yard has long been a favourite among fans of authentic Mediterranean cuisine: a mouth-wateringly good Spanish tapas menu features courgette flowers stuffed with goatâs cheese and drizzled with honey. For more taste sensations, indulge in the Peruvian cuisine craze thatâs taken London by storm. Both Lima and Pisqu serve almost-too-pretty-to-eat dishes among Inca-patterned cushions. Fresh flavours and the punch of a Pisco Sour will transport you to 01. Bao, Lexington Street South America.Artisan businessesJust outside the elegant the apartment is an array of characterful cafÃ©s, buzzing with London life. Walk in to the aroma of freshly ground coffee beans and oven-baked pastries at Tap No.26 â the perfect spot for Saturday morning catch-ups. Moments away is Fernandez & Wells, set in a stunning 1930s brick building. On the menu are made-to-order sandwiches and vitamin-packed salads, as well as draught beer on tap. Around the corner, Charlotte Street Hotel charms customers with its low-key luxe dÃ©cor. Famed across London, their Afternoon Tea includes melt-in-themouth raspberry and coconut cupcakes, and irresistible orange macaroons with chocolate ganache. A more recent opening includes the highly rated boutique Japenese coffee chain Omotesando Koffee, which is situated just outside the front door of the building.Shopping/Culture/ArtSurrounding the apartment are Londonâs most notable shopping streets. Boasting big brands and stylish department stores, Oxford Street is Londonâs main shopping artery. Argyll Streetâs world-famous Liberty store displays the best ofBritish fashion and dÃ©cor â from original silk prints to designer homeware. Meanwhile, Soho buzzes with artistic activity. Among its innovative art institutions is Frith Street Gallery, representing contemporary artists in different media,from painting to performance. Nearby, the bright lights of Londonâs West End dazzle theatre-goers every night of the week.Among Londonâs star attractions is The British Museum, covering over two million years of human history. People come from far and wide to catch a glimpse of world treasures such as the Rosetta Stone or the Egyptian mummies, yet itâs just 10 minutes away.Outdoor/ParksResidents have easy access to Londonâs loveliest parks. An emerald oasis in the heart of London, Regentâs Parkâs 395 acres include the rose-scented Queen Maryâs Gardens, a picturesque boating lake, an outdoor sports area, and ZSL London Zoo. Itâs also where youâll find the magical Open Air Theatre, hosting award-winning productions on starry summer nights.Closer still is Soho Square â a historic patch of green behind Oxford Street with a mock-Tudor building at its heart. Itâs a perfect place for a tranquil lunch break on the manicured lawn, or a quiet moment before or after work.                            .
