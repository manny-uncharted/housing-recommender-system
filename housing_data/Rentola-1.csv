the oldest catholic church in the country, a posh place for weddings and worth a visit. the rest of the palace was pulled down and ely place rebuilt in the 18th century. the ancient mitre pub also survives in the alley running between ely place and hatton garden. ely place is still a private road, run by commissioners elected annually by the freeholders and leaseholders. they appoint beadles (whose lodge is by the gates at the end of ely place). the hattons did not prosper. in particular, bleeding heart yard (between ely place and saffron hill) takes its name from the discovery there of the dismembered corpse of lady hatton - believed to have been murdered by a jealous lover. from there on, it was all downhill for several centuries. saffron hill became renowned for its brothels and thieves' rookeries. the fleet river ran where farringdon road is now, and formed a convenient escape route when the law came calling. the area features as the location of a number of low-life characters in the novels of charles dickens (who lived not far away in doughty street). in particular, fagin's den in ""oliver twist"" was situated in saffron hill, and bleeding heart yard features in ""little dorrit"". in the late 19th century clerkenwell became a place for craft, watchmaking and jewellery workshops. it was then a very radical area. karl marx lived next to clerkenwell green when writing ""das kapital"". and hiram maxim invented the machine gun in the building on the corner of hatton garden and clerkenwell road. the area became popular with italian immigrants, and became known as ""little italy"". there is still a sizeable italian community locally, and the italian church on clerkenwell road draws its congregation from far and wide. the craft workshops are still here. but advertising agencies and recording studios (including one in saffron hill) have moved in. and in the last 5 years clerkenwell has become ""fashionable clerkenwell"", with many former commercial premises (the ziggurat was a printing works) converted to residential use. hatton garden is still london's centre for the diamond trade - with lots of jewellery shops and workshops. many are jewish - closed saturday, open sunday. the huge building at the south end of saffron hill is the london headquarters of de beers, and the diamonds are delivered by helicopter to a landing pad on the roof. residential realtors offers the opportunity to make a 'pre viewing reservation' (pvr). pvrs are made on a non-obligation basis and are particularly popular with applicants who reside abroad and those unable to view properties as quick as required. pvr can be made at any point before your scheduled viewing, this gives you peace of mind that the property is reserved for you until your scheduled viewing slot. if you are not interested in the property after your viewng your pvr will be refunded to you within 24 hours. to make a 'pre viewing reservation' simply call residential realtors office on and member of the lettings team will be happy to walk you through the process. payments can be made over the telephone with a valid credit/debit card or via bank transfer. residential realtors offers late evening viewings and early morning veiwings along with most weekends, to arrange a vieiwngs simply call our lettings team on .00 + vat per person",51.5191478,-0.1059205,1,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,

 The area: Why we love Lancaster Gate & Bayswater



 Why we love... Lancaster Gate & Bayswater
 Bayswater is one of London’s most cosmopolitan areas; renowned for its signature white Stucco fronted terraced houses and peaceful garden squares, many of which have been converted into flats. The architecture, combined with the central location, attracts successful young professionals and wealthy families. There is a significant international population with residents from the Arab countries, Greece, America and Brazil. What makes this area so unique is that despite its extremely central position Bayswater borders Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens that gives the area a sense of calm amongst the usual London hustle & bustle.
The location is quite simply superb; literally everything you need is within walking distance. The area boasts fantastic transport links, featuring key tube lines, major bus access, and walking distance to Paddington station for the Heathrow Express (15 minutes to the airport).
The area is a great destination for dining; there is a fantastic collection of ethnic cafes and restaurants serving international cuisine. It is also a shopper’s paradise, home to London’s oldest shopping center Whiteleys and a short distance from the world famous Selfridges department store.
