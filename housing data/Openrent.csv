It is home to a plethora of cultures and peoples from all over the U. K. and from around the world, which makes it a much more interesting environment to live in than was previously the case (say 5 â 10 years ago).   And, there is a multitude of newly opened shops, bars, restaurants, gyms, markets and places of entertainment, etc, close by (some of them open 24 hours) all the way from the property to the newly developed Elephant & Castle area in one direction,  and to the fast developing Camberwell area in the other, providing you with an abundant supply of places to go and things to see and do in the local area â day or night!   Markets: East Street market is the closest. You can find some amazing bargains here. Other markets not so far away include Borough market, Lower Marsh Food Market, Bermondsey Square Farmers and Antiques Markets, Oval Farmersâ Market, and the New Covent Garden Flower Market(s) are all close byâ¦between 5 and 15 minutes on the bus, approximately.    Parks: Burgess Park (one of the largest in Southeast London) is just around the corner (1 â 2 minutesâ walk), and Kennington Park is about 5 â 10 minutesâ walk awayâ¦so quite close too. Burgess Park has a big lake for boating and fishing, an internationally recognised BMX bike racing track, a Tennis Centre, a Preserved Woodland area, an Adventure area (for both children and adults), Football areas, Public Barbecue zones, large entertainment spaces for concerts, circuses and fairs, and an Outdoor Gym, etc, etc!   Shopping, Entertainment & The Arts: within 10 â 20 minutes by bus and / or tube, you will find yourself in the heart of many of Londonâs historic and cultural landmarks. Regent Street, Oxford Street, Knightsbridge, Kensington (for The Natural History and V & A Museums, etc), Hyde Park (for the many festivals and shows, etc, throughout the yearâ¦including The Winter Wonderland around Christmas time), The Tower of London, The South Bank Centre, including The Hayward Gallery, The National Theatre and Royal Festival Hall are also close by, as are the IMAX cinema at Waterloo, the National Film Museum, Shakespeareâs Globe, The Imperial War Museum, The Tate Modern, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, The Royal Opera House and The Coliseum, Covent Garden and Theatre & Film Land around Leicester Square, on the Strand as well as on Shaftsbury Avenue, etc, in the West Endâ¦ and letâs not forget the City of Londonâ¦the financial heart (and brain) of the U. K.! I could go onâ¦   Sport: A Gym, just 3 â 5 minutesâ walk away on the Walworth Road, and now also at the NEW Elephant & Castle Leisure Centre (12 â 15 minutesâ walk away), are open 24 hours. Thereâs very cheap (sometimes freeâ¦) swimming as well at Camberwell Leisure Centre (just 12 - 15 minutesâ walk in the other direction - towards Camberwell Green). Thereâs also a Rock-Climbing wall at Vauxhall (under the railway arches) as well as, of course, the world famous Oval Cricket Ground close by (between Vauxhall, Kennington and Camberwell).   More about The Elephant & Castle (just 12 â 15 minutesâ walk away): FYI, over the next few years, the Elephant & Castle will become London's most exciting new neighbourhood in a Â£1.5bn transformation that will evolve and enhance its identity. It will very soon become known as âthe place to beâ rather than just âa place to pass throughâ.   Already a lively London neighbourhood, The Elephant & Castle offers all the convenience of a Zone 1 location. Known affectionately to the locals as 'The Elephant', the area has a rich history stretching back to medieval timesâ¦and so much more to offer residents, visitors, and investors, etc, alike.   Located in a prime position in the heart of (south) central London, The Elephant & Castle is an excellent transport hub, with a Mainline Train station (direct trains to Kings Cross, Luton, Gatwick Airport and Brighton), a Zone 1 Tube station, of course, and links to nearly 50 different Bus routes. Fast and frequent London Underground services connect you to the whole of London via the Northern and Bakerloo lines.   Once all the main infrastructure projects have been completed, The Elephant & Castle will become one of the first fully Internet and social media friendly residential neighbourhoods in the whole of London.   GETTING AROUND:   The property is also, approximately, 15 - 20 minutesâ walk (5 - 10 minutes by bus & 7 - 10 minutes by bike) away from the Elephant & Castle Underground and Overground Stations, with their fast connections to anywhere you can think of in London and beyond.    The property is also served by a myriad of day and night buses stopping nearby (approx. 2 minutesâ walk in either direction). They can also get you quickly to where you need to be.   There are various âpedalâ bike stations 5 â 7 mins walk away (approx), with several others all along the Walworth Road up to the Elephant & Castle station. There are many cycle routes to choose from, including the CS7.   Parking: If required, Parking Permits can be applied for through the Southwark Council website.   On Foot: FYI, Borough Market is around 25 mins away, London Bridge about 30 mins, The South Bank is approximately 40 mins away, Covent Garden and Leicester Squareâ¦ 50 mins, Euston, St. Pancras, and Kingâs Cross stationsâ¦just over an hour (each).

"2 Bed Penthouse, Leonard Street, EC2A"," Key Points Becoming available November 2023. Fantastic location Minutes walk from the centre of the City of London, from Liverpool St Station, from Old St underground Located in Central Shoreditch - currently home to 7 of the UKâs top 100 restaurants - and endless more restaurants, bars, cafes and clubs, Brick Lane and Spitalfields Countless art, music and cultural events in the neighbourhood Overlooking wonderful old yellow London brick warehouses Property Description A huge 90m2 2-bed, 2 bathroom, with a massive reception room, flooded with daylight from windows running the length of the property. The full-length balcony overlooks the vibrant Leonard Street (inside Congestion Zone). This Penthouse is one of only 6 residential units in the building which stands on a former wartime bomb-site. It is absolutely centrally located to modern London and the area that has been at the heart of the East End revival: much of modern British Art (like it or not) and part of Hoxton ( so hip it hurts!). Located in the Creative area, minutes walk from the financial district,  it is an unbeatable location but the (relatively) small size of the block keeps it in contact with the vibrant surrounding streets.

"Room in a Shared Flat, Maida Vale, W9","                                The flat is located in Clive court on the 4th floor. The room is the biggest in the flat & comes with a beautiful private en suite and private balcony. The kitchen, the main bathroom with a shower and living room / balcony are shared. Thereâs lots of transport around as the area is just outside of central London. Warwick Avenue, Maida Vale, Edgware Road & St Johnâs Wood stations are all within walking distance of the flat. Lots of buses too. The 2 current tenants are both 21. One is employed full time the other is a student going into his final year. They are friendly, funny, go out most weekends but rarely have people in the flat. Theyâre clean and well mannered. I think theyâd suit a couple, pair of friends who donât mind sharing the room or a single tenant. The council tax band is F. The bills donât add up to too much as heating & electricity are included in the rent. Separate bills are water and wifi. The living room and kitchen are furnished.

"3 Bed Flat, Marlborough Court, W8","                                This immaculate three-bedroom apartment is conveniently located in a portered mansion block in Kensington. It has been recently renovated so that it now combines an excellent use of space with an exuberance of materials and colour.The apartment is situated on the fourth floor of Marlborough Court, a handsome red-brick 1930's mansion block, and is accessed via lift or stairs.The apartment comprises 1,100 square feet of light-filled interiors. Walnut hardwood flooring extends throughout, providing a natural grounding to the bold coloured walls. The internal doors â which are predominantly sliding pocket doors â are all full-height, contributing to the overall sense of volume.The double reception area is fitted with Lutron lighting and occupies a three-bay window frontage, where double glazed windows flood the room with morning and afternoon light. The bespoke kitchen is fitted with Smeg appliances and is partially open to the living and dining space. A quartz worktop is set against hague blue cabinets and matching quartz splashback appears to extend the room beyond its generous limits.Three bedrooms are spread along the southern aspect. There are two similarly sized double bedrooms both with built-in wardrobes. The main bedroom incorporates built-in floor to ceiling hand-painted wardrobes matching the colour of the walls.The apartment benefits from a large, private, communal garden to the rear of the property.

"Room in a Shared Flat, Mayfield Close, E8","                                Looking for one person to complete a two bed spacious flat with me and my gorgeous little beagle in Dalston. Iâm a mid 30s female from Devon and Oli is an 11 year old beagle from Ecuador. I work at home a few days a week so would be looking for someone who works the majority of the week out of the flat. Iâd love someone chilled and independent who has their own life but also wants to share the occasional dinner, watch a movie or grab a drink in one of the many bars in Dalston. Iâm fairly quiet during the week, but still like to go out sometimes at the weekend and spend my time reading, would be great to live with someone similar. Iâm not looking to live with a couple and if you have a partner I think it works best if they were only with us less than half the week. Obviously itâs really important that you love dogs, Oli loves everyone so heâll want to spend time with you. The photos are of the flat previously, the furniture is different as Iâm currently in the process of furnishing it myself, if you have your own furniture that you wanted to bring then let me know. The flat is quite spacious with lovely tiled floors and a cute balcony. Thereâs a communal garden that people use a lot and Iâm pretty sure we can get you parking if you need it. Ideally Iâd like someone to move in asap so please let me know when youâd be able to move in. If youâre interested then please message me if youâd like to come by and tell me a bit about you and why you think we might be a good fit. Looking forward to hearing from you!

"1 Bed Flat, Mildmay Grove North, N1","                                Due to a change in circumstances, we are moving out of our lovely Canonbury flat and looking for someone / a couple to take over the lease. The flat is available from 10th august, and the lease runs until May 2024 (break clause) or can be continued until November 2024. Weâve absolutely loved living here - itâs a brilliant location with Dalston on the doorstop and the charm of Canonbury surroundings. Newington Green is a two minute walk away. The neighbours are absolute gems and you probably couldnât wish for better! There is lovely outdoor space which is looked after by one of the upstairs owners. Closest stations are Dalston Kingsland (6min walk) and Canonbury (also around 6 min walk). Superb bus links into the city. Highbury and Islington is the closest underground station, getting to Oxford Circus within a few minutes. We plan to hold viewings through mid July, and look forward to meeting you!

You are also across the road from Cambridge Heath overground station with direct links to Liverpool Street as well as an 8 minute walk to Bethnal Green station (central line). This is a unique pub conversion, split-level flat, with many retained period features. We also recently refurbished the kitchen and downstairs shower room. The living space is very generous compared to a lot of London flats, there is a large living room with comfy corner sofa, dining space and desk/study area. The kitchen is separate and also huge with space to dine (we currently have a second sofa in there as there is a breakfast bar also)There are 2 good sized double bedrooms, one is larger than the other with a king size bed and built in wardrobes. The other is a little smaller, but still has a double bed, wardrobe, room for drawers and dual aspect windows so it is nice and bright. What makes this bedroom special is your own mezzanine storage area accessed by a little flight of stairs. There is also an attic room, currently we use this as storage but it has been used as a spare room in the past as well as a snug and meditation space. The ceilings are low, you can't stand up in it but it's a useful extra space that you can use how you would like. Lastly, there is a gorgeous bathroom with roll-top bath and a newly fitted skylight and a little separate cloakroom.Please note Bills are not included in the price of the apartment.

"1 Bed Flat, Boleyn Road, N16","                                A tidy, stylish, and functional 1 bedroom apartment in the centre of Dalston. I bought this apartment 6 years ago off plan when the development was launched. I am a project manager in the construction industry, and thus it has been kept in excellent condition. I have added a few luxury features such as the walk-in wardrobe, media wall, library wall, and upgraded LED lighting. The apartment comes fully furnished including the Samsung Frame TV 55"" and Sonos system. The apartment is situated on the first floor and has a long private outdoor terrace (7mx1.5m), on the same level as the shared roof terrace for residents. This has turned out to be a great advantage as it feels like an extension to your own private garden (it barely gets used).

"2 Bed Flat, Brixton Water Lane, SW2","                                SHORT TERM LET ONLY: AUTUMN 2023. This beautiful Victorian conversion ground floor garden flat sits metres from the gates to Brockwell Park and 7 minutesâ walk in either direction to Brixton tube or Herne Hill station. Comprised of 2 double bedrooms - 1 larger, 1 smaller - the flat is arranged in an L shape around a walled courtyard garden. A large sitting room with bay windows, colourful furnishings and art work complements a retro eat-in kitchen at the other end of the flat, joined by a hallway-library. Iâve lived here for 12 years and love this neighbourhood with its diverse culture and restaurants, not to mention Londonâs best park (boasting tennis courts, lido, BMX track, duck ponds, London skyline, manor house, meadows and vast varieties of trees). Iâm looking for part-time renters (a couple, friends or a single person) while I spend the Autumn in France. More than anything Iâm seeking the right people to live in and cherish the space. As Iâm moving out of the country for a few months the flat will be let as seen ie with art work, furnishings, books, plants, kitchenware etc. Thatâs why it matters to me that the right people want to live here.Bills are cÂ£156/m (water, council tax, Wi-Fi) but are not inclusive of electricity and gas so Iâd transfer the energy bill (gas & electric) to whoever rents it so youâd be in control of and responsible for what you use. A weekly cleaner is included in the rent. Iâm open to a dialogue on whether to extend the tenancy depending on how my time abroad works out. I understand not everyone will be up for such an arrangement but happy to meet those of you who are. Please save us all some time by only requesting a viewing if the criteria fit - Mid Sep- early/mid Dec let, 2 people max, fully furnished etc. Viewings available now - evenings and weekdays. I look forward to hearing from you!

"Room in a Shared Flat, Gascony Avenue, NW6","                                Lovely double bedroom available for rent in this spacious and stylish 3 bedroom apartment with patio/garden. You would be sharing with 2 professional females, we are 27 and 49 years old and get on extremely well. We also have 2 affectionate dogs at home, Bandit (Shiba Inu) and Sunny (Labrador cross). We are friendly and sociable and whilst we often spend time together watching TV, making dinner, socialising over a glass of wine or two, fussing over the dogs, having an occasional dinner party, we also quite like doing our own thing, the mood is very spontaneous and relaxed and we would love someone who is easy going and fits in with our home life. Important part to mention is that a suitable housemate would need to be very much at ease around dogs and not allergic to dog hair ;) , we have a weekly cleaner but with 2 dogs around there will inevitably be some dog hair lurking. We like to keep our home tidy and clean (not OCD but to a healthy level) so we would expect the same. Other than that we are simply hoping for general common sense, mindfulness and respect in a household to make everyoneâs home life enjoyable. The bedroom comes with double bed frame with 2 storage draws and a headboard (also a very good quality mattress). There is some space to fit a desk if you need to. Also there is a triple door wardrobe with hanging space and shelving (one of the doors has a full length mirror). There is a large open plan modern kitchen and a living room, French doors opening onto a wrap-around patio/garden, 1 full bathroom and an additional separate WC. The room is available from 1st September. If you are interested please get in touch.

"3 Bed Flat, Bronte House, SW4"," Newly refurbished, spacious and characterful three bedroom flat which is handily situated for the retail and transport hubs of Brixton, Balham and Clapham South. This would ideally suit a group of three friends because as well as three good size double rooms, there is a large communal living room with enough room for separate dining and lounge areas. And this leads on to one of the real gems of this flat - a 5 metre long private balcony, totally secluded, and has unspoilt views of the lush estate gardens, and beyond that is even more green space as we border a park. This flat has genuine character to it, maybe itâs the restored wood floors or the original features dotted around; either way, itâs an easy place to feel at home.It's a ground floor flat in a quiet-but-friendly 1930s redbrick estate - people even talk to their neighbours sometimes! Itâs about 8 mins walk from Clapham South tube on the Northern Line as well as the many sports activities on Clapham Common itself. There are several rental bike companies that serve the area which is a very easy and fast way to get around. There is a large Tesco, an M&S food, a large Waitrose, Sainsburyâs and a Lidl all within reach for grocery shopping.The rooms all come with double beds, wardrobes, desks, and lots of storage space. The rooms are self-contained enough to offer privacy and space to work but then there are the big communal areas for when you want to unwind and relax with flatmates.There is a well-equipped kitchen with lots of worktop and cupboard space. There is a big fridge freezer, washing machine, tumble dryer, induction hob oven, steam cleaner. Youâll have responsibility for the standard utility bills but the flat is all set up to a high standard e.g. there is fibre wifi plus mesh hubs across the flat which is able to handle multiple people working/streaming/being online at the same time. There is also a smart meter and individual temperature controls on each radiator plus a central wifi thermostat to help you keep the place cosy but also keep control of your energy use.The flat is currently empty but now ready for occupancy as soon as possible. So Iâm looking for 3 people to jointly take it on as a new tenancy. Contact me with a little info about you and your search and when you would like to move / view. I will be doing in-person viewings over the next few days.

This incredibly stylish house is comprised of an open plan double reception room with solid oak floors and an impressive wood burning stove for those winter months, an extended family/kitchen dining room drenched in natural light which leads onto a delightful south facing yet low maintenance garden. A suntrap no less! Over the upper two floors of the house are four double bedrooms and two bathrooms which are presented to the same exacting standards offered on the ground floor. Houses of this calibre are rarely seen on the market for long so my advice is to see it while you can.This house is situated a stone's throw from one of London's best and most renowned Primary school, St Stephen's CE Primary ages from 3 - 11.Viewings from the 24th July.  Property is free anytime from 10th August.   ","£5,500.00","£5,500.00",No,             View Offers         ,No,No,No,No,,"10 August, 2023",12 Months,,No,No,No,Unfurnished,B,"[[""                                        Shepherd's Bush Market                                    "", '                                        6 minute walk                                    '], ['                                        Goldhawk Road                                    ', '                                        8 minute walk                                    '], [""                                        Shepherd's Bush (Central)                                    "", '                                        14 minute walk                                    '], ['                                        Wood Lane                                    ', '                                        14 minute walk                                    ']]",No,,,
"2 Bed Flat, Trinder Road, N19","                                This charming flat occupies the upper half of a terraced house on a quiet residential street located equidistant between Crouch End and Stroud Green. The local area is a genuinely wonderful part of London: within 15 minutes you can be in Finsbury Park, Alexandra Palace, Priory Park, Queen's Wood, Highgate Wood, or the Parkland Walk for space and exercise; in the bars and restaurants of Crouch End and the Stroud Green Road for a night out; at the Art House or Picturehouse to watch a film; or at the Park Road lido for an open air swim. The area is still full of independent, interesting businesses, and there are a number of excellent food produce shops -- whether delicatessens, fruit and veg sellers, or butchers.The W7 bus leaves from the end of the road, and arrives at Finsbury Park station within eight minutes; from there, the Victoria and Piccadilly Lines head into the middle of town, and there are trains heading direct into the City (Moorgate 14 minutes), and even direct to Gatwick Airport. The flat is also situated very near to Crouch Hill overground station, which is useful for getting up to Walthamstow, and to destinations in the west of London like Richmond and Kew.          The flat is bright and spacious, and presents a calm, understated and modern feel. It has been renovated and maintained to a very high standard over the past five years. There are wooden floors throughout, with a solid oak parquet that was recently laid in the lower half of the flat changing into elegantly painted floorboards in the upstairs bedroom. All the windows in the flat are sashes, which have been renovated and double-glazed within the last four years. The heart of the flat is a combined open-plan kitchen, dining area and living room. The kitchen has an induction hob, single oven, fridge / freezer and Bosch clothes washer / dryer. The three-sided kitchen surface is very generous for food preparation, and could also double as a breakfast bar. Next to the kitchen, the wide open room could simply be used as a very spacious living room; or -- as is the case currently -- divided into a dining area with ample space for a large dining table, next to a living area still with sufficient space for a sofa, armchairs and a sideboard.   The central stairway gives a real sense of flow to the flat, so that none of the rooms in the flat feel disconnected or remote. Despite that, the three distinct levels of the flat each retain a sense of privacy and self-sufficiency -- not least because each bedroom has its own separate bathroom.Heading up the staircase from the central living room, the main bedroom occupies the whole depth of house from front to back. The main feature of the bedroom is a distinctive painted brick chimney breast, next to which a beautiful ply-edged wardrobe has been custom-built, complete with oak veneer shelving for books and plants. In the same style as the wardrobe, a custom eaves storage unit runs the full width of the room and also provides some bed-side storage. Next to the back window that looks out over trees and gardens, there is plenty of room for a small office. The bedroom has its own bathroom, with full size bath, and more useful hidden eaves storage for larger items such as suitcases.Heading downstairs from the central living room, there is a second bedroom at the back of the flat, also with its own bathroom with a walk-in waterfall shower. The second bedroom is sufficiently spacious for an adult double bed and clothes storage or, as is currently the case, for two children's beds and equipment. Alternatively, this room could serve as a spacious and quiet office.In the front garden of the flat, there is a large Asgard metal bike storage shed that is exclusively for the use of the flat tenants.
