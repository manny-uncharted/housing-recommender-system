The house is Grade II listed and has undergone an extensive and transformative refurbishment to create a lavish gated development comprising  of six stately apartments and six contemporary houses within the grounds.Apartment 3 is a wonderful lower ground apartment with its own entrance. The spacious high specification kitchen entertaining area has French doors opening up on to a terrace. There are also two well proportioned bedrooms, one with a contemporary en suite and both benefiting a luxurious family bathroom. The apartment benefits from extensive communal gardens, parking and leisure facilities. History Beltwood House is a beautiful neoclassical Victorian mansion situated in a private parkland setting extending to just over three acres.  This important architectural jewel is Grade II listed and has been sensitively restored to its former glory by a heritage-focused team of skilled craftspeople and artisans.  The house sits within protected woodland, part of the Dulwich Wood Conservation Area, with many of the trees protected by preservation orders.  Architecturally, Beltwood House has a rich heritage and is believed to have been designed by Robert Richardson Banks and Charles Barry Jr, who between them designed the main building of Dulwich College, Bylaugh Hall in Norfolk, the forecourt of Burlington House and 12 Kensington Palace Gardens, currently the Russian Embassy. Moreover, Barry's father designed the Houses of Parliament (Palace of Westminster), perhaps the most influential Gothic Revival building in the world.  A formal Italianate parterre garden was added to the grounds of Beltwood House at a later date.  One of the main goals in renovating Beltwood House and its grounds was to preserve this historic home and facilitate its removal from the English Heritage 'At Risk' register, restoring it to its original glory. Forming part of the Dulwich Estate (a charity established in 1619 to endow Dulwich College, and the guardian of the heritage of much of the Dulwich area) and, originally, the Great North Wood (an ancient wood which extended from Deptford in the north to Croydon in the south, remnants of which survive on the site itself and in Sydenham Hill Wood and Dulwich Wood), it is a unique property in a distinctive, sylvan setting.Available to rent through Knight Frank Dulwich.

It’s within walking distance to both the West End and the City! Four bedroom flats in such a central location are really difficult to find, especially at this price. Other good things about the flat are its proximity to three supermarkets (Waitrose, Tesco and Sainsbury’s all a stone’s throw away), its fibre optic internet connectivity (up to 120Mbps with Virgin Media) and cheap bills (gas central heating + unmetered water supply). Also, the landlord was a real pleasure to work with. Right from the start it was easy to tell that Jason is a reasonable, straightforward and responsive landlord. For example, he did not demand any hidden or extra fees (agency administration fees, property inspection etc) payable upon the start of the tenancy! We really appreciated how he was both a trustworthy and trusting person in all his dealings - that was certainly unlike most other landlords that we have encountered!""Another Testimonial from tenants:""We chose this apartment because of its great location and the spacious rooms. There are supermarkets nearby, two tube stations within walking distance and it is near to our school campus. For the given location, we felt that the rent rate was a very good deal. Overall, we had a great experience. Jason & Mina (the landlords) are very friendly and flexible even though we were international students.

Part of the Lower Lea Valley, Stratford is situated 6 miles (9.7 km) east-northeast of Charing Cross, and includes the localities of Maryland and East Village.Historically, part of the parish of West Ham, which formed an ancient parish in the hundred of Becontree in Essex. Following reform of local government in London in 1965, the parish and borough of West Ham was abolished, becoming part of the borough of Newham in the newly formed Greater London.Stratford grew rapidly in the 19th century following the introduction of the railway to the area in 1839, forming part of the conurbation of London, similar to much of south-west Essex. The late 20th century was a period of severe economic decline in the area, eventually reversed by ongoing regeneration associated with the 2012 Summer Olympics, for which Stratford's Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, part of the large, multi-purpose Stratford City development, was the principal venue. The Westfield Stratford City shopping centre, one of the largest urban shopping centres in Europe, opened in 2011. Stratford is east London's primary retail, cultural and leisure centre, and has also become the second most significant business location in east London after Canary Wharf.

Thamesmead South SE2 split from the SE28 thamesmead, 'this is the original development In 2000, TTL was wound down and two new organisations were created. In broad terms, Gallions Housing Association took over the ownership and management of the housing assets whilst Tilfen, later Tilfen Land, took over the remaining undeveloped land. Tilfen is jointly owned by Gallions and Trust Thamesmead.District heating and cable radio broadcasting were pioneered in Thamesmead. The District Heating System was decommissioned around the turn of the millennium, with those properties connected to it having wet radiator systems installed by the landlord.Pilkington Canal (also called Broadwater Canal) - used to connect to Woolwich Arsenal, now remain as a water feature in the estates In time more facilities developed with a supermarket and retail park near Gallions Reach. Bus services were improved and people living on Thamesmead are now more easily able to reach Abbey Wood Station, which is a main stop on the line.View of canary wharf from Thamesmead North during the peak hours Transport Thamesmead's location between the Thames and the South London escarpment limits rail transport and road access points.  Most residents rely on bus services to reach the nearest rail stations.[citation needed] There is a disused railway trackbed from Plumstead which once served the Royal Arsenal. Buses serving Thamesmead include services B11, 177, 180, 229, 244, 380, 401, 469, 472, 601, 602, 669 and the night bus N1.Nearest railway stationsAbbey Wood railway stationPlumstead railway stationBelvedere railway stationWoolwich Arsenal railway stationGeography Thamesmead  today has four distict areas:Thamesmead South is in Bexley and is the location of the original development built in the late 1960s to early 1970s. The buildings are almost entirely of concrete, in a Cubist/Brutalist/Modernist style, and include a number of high-rise blocks. It is east of Harrow Mannor Way (A2041) and south of the A2016.Thamesmead Central is in Greenwich and was first developed in the early 1980s in the ring between the A206 and A2041. It originally consisted of large, sprawling, concrete and red brick, eight- and nine-storey estates overlooking the A2041, and three-storey red-brick town houses. It has spread west of the A2041 and now also includes a number of red and yellow brick homes built from the 1990s onwards.Thamesmead North is split between Bexley & Greenwich and is north of the A2016 and east of the A2041. Built from the 1970s onwards, it was initially made up of town houses in grey brick; more recent builds are in red & yellow brick.Thamesmead West is in Greenwich near Woolwich and Plumstead (Between Whinchat Road, the A2016 & the banks of the river Thames) and was built from the 1990s onwards. It is a significant distance from the original development and consists mainly of medium density residential development with yellow brick fascias, with towers along the riverside.Thamesmead now features a retail park finished in brick anchored around a Morrisons Supermarket; there is also a shopping parade which has mainly serviced based outlets such as hairdressers and estate agents. It contains a clock tower and lake, which may seem contrived. Thamesmead West contains Gallions Ecopark a pioneering small  housing development with homes built to high energy efficiency and environmental standards. The estate also includes a small lake and Gallions Hill (viewpoint hill).Part of Thamesmead West is also sometimes referred to as ""Gallions Reach Urban Village"". This can lead to confusion, as it is on the opposite bank of the River Thames from Gallions Reach DLR station and Gallions Reach shopping park. There is no Docklands Light Railway, London Underground or rail station in Thamesmead West.Most of the land area of Thamesmead previously formed about 1,000 acres (4.0 km2) of the old Royal Arsenal site that extended over Plumstead Marshes and Erith Marshes. There is some evidence of prehistoric human occupation of the area - flints, animal bone and charcoal were found in bore holes around Western and Central Way in 1997 by the Museum of London Archaeological Service (MOLAS). In Roman times, the river level was significantly lower, and work by MOLAS in 1997 around Summerton Way found evidence of field ditches and pottery and quernstones from Germany dating from around the 3rd or 4th century. After the Roman era, river levels rose again and the area reverted to marshland.[4] According to Hasted, some areas of this marshland were drained by 1279 by the monks of Lesnes Abbey.Between 1812 and 1816, a canal was built (by convicts) to take materials (such as Timber) from the River Thames to Woolwich Royal Arsenal. Much of this canal has been filled in, but part remains in Thamesmead West and is now called the Broadwater. A lock gate and swing bridge (disused) still exists beside the River Thames over the canal.
